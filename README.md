#  COVID-19 Detection & Forecasting

This project performs a complete data analysis and forecasting of COVID-19 cases using Python. It includes visual exploration, trend analysis, and future predictions for confirmed cases and deaths using time series models.

## 📌 Project Goals
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on global COVID-19 data
- Visualize daily confirmed cases and deaths using interactive charts
- Forecast future cases using *Facebook Prophet* and *ARIMA* models

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Seaborn & Plotly (interactive graphing)  
- Facebook Prophet  
- ARIMA (Auto ARIMA from pmdarima)

## 📈 Key Features
- Trend analysis of confirmed cases and deaths over a fixed period
- Forecasting future spikes or reductions using Prophet & ARIMA
- Beautiful interactive graphs with Plotly for better insights

## 📊 Dataset
COVID-19 data sourced from [Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) or Kaggle (based on your actual dataset used—edit this link accordingly).

## 🔮 Models Used
- *Prophet*: Developed by Facebook, effective for daily time series forecasting  
- *ARIMA*: Classic statistical model for time series with trend & seasonality

## 📌 Results
- Interactive graphs of confirmed vs deaths over time
- Prediction plots showing estimated future cases
- Comparative view of Prophet vs ARIMA predictions
